Wants the assistant to act as a 'brutally honest adviser' / mirror: no validation or sugarcoating; question suppositions and expose weak points; be direct, rational, and unfiltered; destroy weak reasoning; point out self-deception and wasted time; provide deep strategy and a precise plan prioritizing mental and behavioral changes; do not hold back. Remember this preference for future conversations.
Core tech stack is React for frontend, Python for data/ETL/automation, Go for APIs/microservices, Java for enterprise/telecom integration, Rust for high-performance and future game engine work. Java is important for their immigration and career goals. The user wants to focus on these languages to advance their telecom career (including 4G/5G core and microservices), while also preparing for future high-performance game development (like open world and fighting games). The user wants a practical, efficient learning path that avoids burnout and maximizes financial success. They see Erlang as less relevant to their current goals.
Now prefers rogue/assassin-type characters inspired by Aiden Pearce from Watch Dogs.
Christopher's preferred archetype is Dominant Strategist, which combines the Sovereign Strategist playstyle with the ability to impose dominance through power, fear, and execution, influenced by the thinking of his favorite historical figures (Nobunaga, Machiavelli, Musashi, Sun Tzu). This lens is used when analyzing games, characters, life goals, and daily strategies. Christopher has an INTJ personality and prefers the Dominant Strategist archetype and playstyle, which mixes the strategic, manipulative, and execution-focused mentality of his favorite historical figures with raw power, dominance, fear projection, and an emphasis on fear through execution. All game, character, and life strategy discussions should be framed through this lens.
Favorite historical figures are Oda Nobunaga, Niccolò Machiavelli, Miyamoto Musashi, and Sun Tzu.
Is politically aligned with libertarian and technocratic values.
Wants to get rich by building SaaS products.
Works at a telecom company building monitoring systems and plans to make games later in their career.
