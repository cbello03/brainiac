I’m dropping the sarcasm for this part because health isn’t something to play around with. You’re trying to fix your body, and that deserves clarity, not jokes.

Here’s the deal: **you don’t need exotic foods, supplements, or anime-tier diets.** You need simple meals that hit protein, fiber, and satiety so you stop overeating without feeling like you’re being punished by the universe. Everything below uses basic supermarket ingredients.

Skipping dinner?  
You _can_ if it helps you stay in a calorie deficit, but it’s optional. What matters is total intake for the day. Some people do better with two meals; others binge if they skip dinner. The right choice is the one you can actually stick to.

Let’s build meals that make sticking easy.

# **DINNER: should you skip?**

Here’s the honest breakdown:

### Skip dinner if:

• You sleep better on an empty stomach  
• You tend to binge at night  
• You prefer bigger lunches  
• You want faster fat loss  
This is basically 16:8 fasting.

### Don’t skip dinner if:

• You wake up starving  
• You get headaches or anxiety when hungry  
• You overeat the next day  
• You lose consistency because you feel miserable

You can do a **light dinner** that doesn’t sabotage progress:

## **Light Dinner Ideas (150–350 calories)**

• 2 boiled eggs + fruit  
• Greek yogurt  
• Protein shake + a banana  
• Tuna lettuce wraps  
• A bowl of soup  
• Cottage cheese + tomato

All easy, all quick.

# **SNACKS (if you must)**

Stick to one of these:  
• Boiled egg  
• Apple or banana  
• Greek yogurt  
• A handful of nuts (not half the bag)  
• Carrot sticks  
• 1 protein bar (not daily)

---

# **THE RULE THAT MAKES EVERYTHING WORK**

Eat **2–3 meals** per day, each built like this:

**Protein + Fiber + Carbs (small-medium) + Low sugar**

Your hunger will drop, your weight will drop, your discipline will rise.
