You’re not going to love the math, but it’s better to face reality than lie to yourself.

Your BMI is around 40. That’s medically obese. This isn’t a moral judgment, just a measurement. And it’s fixable. Your body isn’t your destiny. Endomorph isn’t a life sentence; it’s just your default setting, not your final form.

And yeah, Toji’s body is basically a walking anatomy poster. You’re not hitting that look by accident. But you _can_ get serious results without a gym or weights. It just takes consistency, not equipment.

Here’s the blunt, practical plan:

## 1. Food matters 10x more than the workout

If you don’t fix the intake, no amount of cardio or calisthenics will save you.  
This part sucks, but it works fast.

• Prioritize protein every meal.  
• Drop liquid calories completely.  
• Keep carbs mostly to morning/afternoon.  
• Simplest winning rule: **eat 20–30% less than you do now**.  
• Track calories for _two weeks_ just to learn how much you're actually eating.  
• High-protein, moderate-fat, low-junk. Nothing fancy. Just sane.

If you do this correctly, you start losing weight literally within 7 days.

## 2. Cardio: yes, but don’t do “hero mode”

People do one brutal run, get destroyed, quit.  
Do this instead:

• 30–45 minutes walking daily  
• Add 10 minutes of “intense” stuff every other day: stairs, jump rope, HIIT rounds at home

Walking burns fat. HIIT boosts metabolism. Easy combo.

## 3. Calisthenics: this is your Toji plan

You don’t need weights. You need progressive overload.

Start with:  
• Pushups (regular, incline, decline over time)  
• Bodyweight squats  
• Planks + side planks  
• Dips on chairs  
• Rows with a backpack or under a table  
• Burpees if you can tolerate suffering

Then level up:  
• Bulgarian split squats  
• Pike pushups  
• Pullups (eventually)  
• Single-leg RDLs  
• Handstand progression

This will actually build muscle. Real muscle. The kind that makes your T-shirt fit properly instead of screaming for help.

Training 20–30 minutes daily is enough. Consistency turns into aesthetics.

## 4. Schedule that fits a busy life

Morning:  
• 20–30 min walk  
Night:  
• 15–20 min calisthenics  
Weekend:  
• 30–45 min cardio burst

That’s it. You don’t need a gym. You need a routine _that doesn’t collapse when your week gets messy_.

## 5. Mindset: your biggest enemy is “all or nothing”

Forget the perfection mindset.  
Do something every single day. Even 10 minutes. Even 5.  
Momentum is worth more than intensity.

## 6. Realistic transformation timeline

With discipline:  
• 3 months: noticeable change  
• 6–7 months: completely different silhouette  
• 12–18 months: Toji-lite physique  
Full Toji requires years, genetics, and probably illegal Japanese demon-juice but you’ll look like a monster compared to now.

You don’t need to chase perfection. You need to destroy the current habits and build simple, repeatable ones.

If you want, I can give you a **full weekly routine** or a **diet plan scaled to Venezuela/US prices**.

Fine, let’s craft something you can follow without overthinking it. No gym, no toys, just you, gravity, and whatever stubbornness you’ve got left.

This is a **3-phase progression**. You move to the next phase when the reps feel “not miserable anymore.”

No romance, no fancy names. Just work.

# **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Weeks 1–4)**

Goal: Lose weight, rebuild joints, wake up your muscles.

**3–4 days per week, 25–35 minutes per session.**

### **1. Pushups**

• 3 sets
• 8–12 reps (incline if you can’t do regulars yet)
• Rest 60–90 seconds

### **2. Bodyweight Squats**

• 3 sets
• 15–20 reps
• Rest 60 seconds

### **3. Plank + Side Planks**

• Standard plank: 30–45 seconds

Stay here until you can hit the max reps with solid form.

# **PHASE 3: POWER & AESTHETICS (Month 3+)**

This is where you start looking like someone who climbs walls in the dark.

**4–6 days per week, 30–45 minutes per session.**

### **1. Pullup Training**

If you can’t do any yet:
• Dead hangs 10–20 seconds x 3

If you can:

# **WEEKLY STRUCTURE (simple and effective)**

Follow this forever until you’re carved out like Toji:

**Mon – Upper (Push + Pull)**
**Tue – Lower + Core**
**Wed – Cardio day**
**Thu – Upper**
**Fri – Lower**
**Sat – Mixed or HIIT**
**Sun – Walk only**

Walking stays daily. It’s free fat-loss.

---

# **How you progress**

• When a rep range feels easy, increase reps
• When reps hit the upper limit (e.g., 20), move to the harder version
• Never train to absolute failure, just close (RPE 8–9)
• Do the sessions even if you feel lazy. That’s how you win.

If you want, I can turn this into a **full daily schedule**, including warmups and a progressive plan for 12 weeks.
