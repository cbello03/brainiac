Absolutely, and good on you for setting a clear and inspiring goal. Toji’s physique—muscular, lean, and athletic—is achievable in a realistic form with time, consistency, and discipline. Since you have a fatty liver (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, likely), we’ll prioritize fat loss, liver-friendly nutrition, strength building, and mobility/agility.

⚠️ Medical Note

Before starting, consult your doctor or a registered dietitian—especially because of the liver condition and current weight status. The plan below assumes you’re cleared for moderate physical activity.

🎯 Goal:

Lose fat safely (~0.5–1 kg/week)

Preserve/build muscle

Improve cardiovascular and liver health

Increase agility & mobility

Eventually reach a lean, muscular physique like Toji (realistically ~80–85kg at 170cm)
